Breast Implant Size Prediction Model
This repository houses the code for a machine learning model that accurately predicts breast implant sizes for augmentation surgeries. The model is trained on a dataset comprising medical records of 1000 patients, including demographic and anthropometric measurements.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: The code includes comprehensive data preprocessing, including handling missing data, outliers, and categorical variables.

Model Training: Utilizes a supervised machine learning algorithm, trained on a dataset from 800 initial cases, to predict the optimal breast implant size based on patient-specific parameters.

Model Testing and Validation: Includes retrospective analysis of an additional 200 cases to validate the model's accuracy in predicting the implant size chosen by the surgeon and patient. This step allows us to assess the model's robustness and reliability in a real-world clinical scenario.

Performance Metrics: The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics  to provide a holistic view of its predictive power and accuracy.

Model Interpretability: The code also includes features importance analysis, providing insights into which variables are most influential in determining the predicted breast implant size.

This machine learning model aims to enhance the accuracy of preoperative assessments, improve patient satisfaction, surgical outcomes, and reduce the likelihood of re-operations due to size adjustments. It represents a significant step towards integrating AI and machine learning in the field of plastic and reconstructive surgery.
